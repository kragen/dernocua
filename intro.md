Dernocua is my notebook from 02021 CE, the second year of the covid
pandemic.  It’s the sequel to [Dercuano] and
[Derctuo].  It contains about 410000 words, about 1100 pages, in 267
notes on various different topics: programming, machining,
electronics, digital fabrication, math, physics, economics, history,
and so on.  These are mostly notes I made while I was figuring things
out, so they have a lot of errors in them because of things I
understood incorrectly, and many of them are incomplete.

Dernocua’s canonical form is [a downloadable tarball of HTML
files][tarball].  For computers that can’t handle tarballs of HTML,
I’ve also hacked together [an inferior PDF rendering of it][pdf],
formatted for comfortable reading on small screens like those on hand
computers.  (In particular, a lot of the Unicode-art stuff is screwed
up in the PDF, and so are tables.)  Errata will be published at [the
GitLab repository][gitlab].

## Public-domain dedication ##

As far as I’m concerned, everyone is free to redistribute Dernocua, in
whole or in part, modified or unmodified, with or without credit; I
waive all rights associated with it to the maximum extent possible
under applicable law.  Where applicable, I abandon its copyright to
the public domain.  I wrote and published Dernocua in Argentina in
02021 (more conventionally called 2021, or 2021 AD).

The exception to the above public-domain dedication is the ET Book
font family used, licensed under [the X11
license](liabilities/LICENSE.ETBook).  This doesn’t impede you from
redistributing or modifying Dernocua but does prohibit you from
removing the font’s copyright notice and license (unless you also
remove the font).  The PDF embeds part of FreeFont and of the DejaVu
fonts, [whose copyright notices are also
included](liabilities/dejavu-copyright), but DejaVu and FreeFont are
not used in the HTML tarball.
